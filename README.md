# Coach

Unusefull and pointless code that will folow your progress in CS:GO, and hopefully will be able to help you train.

## How to use
You have to place a "gamestate_integration_gocoach.cfg" file into your Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\cfg folder.

>Make sure nothing is blocking connection on localhost:3000 or change port in "gamestate_integration_gocoach.cfg" and constructor of MainProgram ( GameStateListener(your_port) ).

Run program with Administrator privileges.

Run CS:GO

When you're done playing press "Save to file" button.

>Safe to use alongside VAC, Faceit Anticheat, ESEA or EAC.

## What it does
It will create folder C:\Training in which data from every day will be saved. 


Code is terrible, classes are viotating all principles, as it ought to be proof of concept, but it proved to be flawed.
